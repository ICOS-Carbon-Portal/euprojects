# A title to describe the published resource.
title: "Global ocean mapping of in-situ measurements of Oxygen, Temperature, Nutrients and pH."

# Additional information about the resource, e.g., a brief abstract.
description: |
  The ocean component consists of a Map Viewer that displays in-situ measurements of the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs)
  Temperature, Oxygen, Nutrients and pH. These measurements are retrieved from the Blue Data Infrastructures (BDIs) Euro-Argo 
  and SeaDataNet CDI using tailor-made APIs for fast sub-setting. The viewer includes a user interface designed for citizen scientists 
  with the possibility to interact with the data by using sliders for time and depth. Background layers from CMEMS are used to compare 
  the in-situ measurements with modelling and satellite products.  

  The in-situ data available for different locations, depths and time periods are used to create scientifically justified aggregated 
  values that feed the dynamic trend indicators at the 1st level of the dashboard, with some configuration options. For the ocean 
  component, the environmental dashboard (level 1) hence includes a number of ocean trend indicators for the chosen EOVs, providing a 
  trend in time for designated areas. While, users can then click on such an indicator guiding them to the Map Viewer (level 2) to browse
  deeper into the data and details facilitating the trends.
